# AWS ECS Project

Welcome to my pet ECS project I created to get a better grasp on Terraform and some AWS concepts. I feel that I learned a lot on this project about containers and orchestration.

This project was inspired by the [Cloud is free Project 3 by ydamni](https://github.com/ydamni/cloud-is-free/tree/main/projects/project-3).

I took the basic concepts of Project 3 and made everything Infrastructure as Code through Terraform, and added a few extra features, such as subdomains, a load balancer, and Cloudwatch log aggregation.

My next project will involve Kubernetes, in order to get a better grasp on how to functionally run a cluster.
